# Match Station

## Overview

**Match Station** is a challenging and engaging Match-3 puzzle game where players match and collect items across various levels. The game tasks players with finding and matching three identical items from a grid of randomly scattered objects, while focusing on collecting specific item types required for each level.

## Gameplay

In **Match Station**, the goal is to match and collect items by forming sets of three identical objects. However, there's a twist: each level requires players to gather only specific types of items. For example, if there are 10 different types of items, you might need to collect all instances of just 2 specific types. The game features 7 tiles where collected items are displayed, and if you can't match three identical items from these tiles, you fail the level. Successfully collecting all required items allows you to advance to the next level.
